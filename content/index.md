title: Template for Knowledge Base Docs Websites
---

This is the index page (`index.md`) of your knowledge base docs. It serves as the home page of your website. 

You can edit this page by editing the `index.md` file in the `content` folder. Using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is recommended. You can also use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any other Markdown editor.

You can also add more pages to your website by adding more Markdown files to the `content` folder.
